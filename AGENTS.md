# Repository Agent Rules

## Environment Secrecy
- Never reveal specific software or system environment details in user-facing output unless the user explicitly requires them to complete the task.
- Never mention absolute filesystem paths, machine-specific usernames, hostnames, operating system details, shell details, sandbox details, secrets, tokens, or similar environment-specific information in user-facing output.
- Relative paths inside the repository are allowed when they help explain changes.

## Prompt Logging
- Before responding to any user prompt, append the exact raw user prompt text to the repository root file `prompt.md`.
- After producing any agent response, append the exact raw agent response text to the repository root file `prompt.md`.
- Log only raw prompts and raw agent responses. Do not log hidden chain-of-thought, tool call payloads, tool outputs, summaries, metadata, timestamps, or any other context.
- Keep entries in append-only order so `prompt.md` is a chronological transcript of raw user prompts and raw agent responses.

## Instruction Structure
- Keep the root `AGENTS.md` focused on repository-wide rules.
- When instructions become domain-specific, workflow-specific, or role-specific, refactor them into more specific nested `AGENTS.md` files or skills instead of overloading the root file.
- Reuse and extend skills whenever that yields clearer, more maintainable agent behavior.

## Logging
- Runtime instrumentation must be written to log files, not rendered as detailed dashboard tables.
- Add general application logging for important runtime behavior, external fetches, warnings, and failures.
- Default logging should use `INFO` in normal debugging contexts and `ERROR` and above in production contexts unless a more specific override is explicitly configured.

## Agent Execution Model
- Use `planner -> executor -> verifier` as the default operating model for non-trivial work.
- Treat low user gating as the default: proceed unless blocked by destructive actions, missing product intent, conflicting constraints, or permissions.
- Use repo-local skills to support decomposition, implementation defaults, and verification gates before adding more root-level rules.
- Allow at most one bounded self-repair cycle after verification failure. Escalate on a second failure with a concise blocker report.

## Language
All code should be in English. The user interface language should be Danish. "slutproduktbeskrivelse.md" should be in Danish. 

## Slutproduktbeskrivelse
slutproduktbeskrivelse.md is the description of the final product as seen from the end user. That's the goal. Read it every time this agents.md is read.
